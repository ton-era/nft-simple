How to mint a new NFT.

---------------------------------------

1. Get deployer and NFT owner addresses (usually these two are the same person at the time of fisrt mint). You also will need deployer's wallet private key.

2. Prepare NFT URI. Fill it in nft-item-mint.fif script.

3. Find correct seqno from working wallet by web query

> curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/runGetMethod' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "address": "kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM",
    "method": "seqno",
    "stack": []
    }'

or by liteclient query

> /opt/liteclient-build/lite-client/lite-client \
        -C /opt/liteclient-build/testnet-global.config.json  \
        -c "runmethod kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM seqno"

4. Run deploy script:

    > cd src
    > ./api.sh mint [SEQNO] [COLLECTION_ADDRESS] [NFT_INDEX]

Here [SEQNO] - the latest deployer's wallet seqno, [COLLECTION_ADDRESS] - parent collection address, [NFT_INDEX] - this item index.
Here is an example output:

    Wallet Address:
    kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM

    Item Owner Address:
    kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM

    Collection Address:
    "kQBbZY6xmT2bnzGXYP+Snz+ZtsISa5VBDw3P58w3GW+i36aU" 

    seqno: 0 
    item index: 0 
    coll amount (ng): 70000000 
    nft amount (ng):  50000000 

This script isn't push a query to blockchain, it only prepares query *.boc file.

5. Run command

    > /opt/liteclient-build/lite-client/lite-client \
        -C /opt/liteclient-build/testnet-global.config.json \
        -c "sendfile build/nft-item-mint-query.boc"

with the proper config file (testnet or mainnet). If everything is OK you'll see green last output with status = 1.
If it's not check [SEQNO] parameter is correct.

5. Check collection address in explorer. For testnet it will be
https://testnet.ton.sh/address/[COLLECTION_ADDRESS]

It should has 0.07 TON input transaction and 0.05 output one.
Check a "To" address for the last transaction - this is the address of new NFT. Its balance should be approx 0.05 TON, State = active.

6. You can get NFT address from its collection API:

> curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/runGetMethod' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "address": "kQBbZY6xmT2bnzGXYP-Snz-ZtsISa5VBDw3P58w3GW-i36aU",
    "method": "get_nft_address_by_index",
    "stack": [["num", 0]]
    }'

If everything is OK you'll get correct response with base64-encoded NFT address:
gBntQMBgfnb7aEQweH0Ji1heRiKV9SImje1JK0W3fB+HYA== 

Decode it to bytes - it will have 34 Bytes:
34*8 = 272 = 3(flags) + 8(wc) + 256(addr) + 5(tail)
