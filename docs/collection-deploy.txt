How to deploy a new NFT collection.

---------------------------------------

1. Get deployer, owner and royaltee addresses (usually these three are the same person). You also will need deployer's wallet private key.

2. Prepare collection URI and item base URI. Fill it in nft-collection-deploy.fif script.

3. Find correct seqno from working wallet by web query

> curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/runGetMethod' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "address": "kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM",
    "method": "seqno",
    "stack": []
    }'

or by liteclient query

> /opt/liteclient-build/lite-client/lite-client \
        -C /opt/liteclient-build/testnet-global.config.json  \
        -c "runmethod kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM seqno"

4. Run deploy script:

    > cd src
    > ./api.sh deploy [SEQNO] [COLLECTION_INIT_GRAMS]

Here [SEQNO] - the latest deployer's wallet seqno, [COLLECION_INIT_GRAMS] - initial transfer from deployer's wallet to collection new address (in nanotons, usually 50000000 nTON = 0.05 TON)
Here is an example output:

    Owner Address:
    kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM

    Roylaty Address:
    kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM

    Wallet Address:
    kQAWYHnDf8qmG9mC1CGD1Svf9_9OjWpDgL9EU2fgsTrfHyNM

    Collection Address:
    kQDQL9NTgE2LZNW3IkyEjRwEY-hKboYiGtZoCKAVanhp-XAE

    seqno: 22 
    amount (ng): 50000000

You can see new collection address kQDQL...XAE along with all other addresses.
This script isn't push a query to blockchain, it only prepares query *.boc file.

5. Run command

    > /opt/liteclient-build/lite-client/lite-client \
        -C /opt/liteclient-build/testnet-global.config.json \
        -c "sendfile build/nft-collection-deploy-query.boc"

with the proper config file (testnet or mainnet). If everything is OK you'll see green last output with status = 1.
If it's not check [SEQNO] parameter is correct.

6. Check collection address in explorer. For testnet it will be
https://testnet.ton.sh/address/[NEW_COLLECTION_ADDRESS]

It should has Balance > 0 (approx 0.05 TON), State = active.

7. Run some collection smartcontract method like

> curl -X 'POST' \
    'https://testnet.toncenter.com/api/v2/runGetMethod' \
    -H 'accept: application/json' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "address": "[NEW_COLLECTION_ADDRESS]",
    "method": "get_collection_data",
    "stack": []
    }'

If everything is OK you'll get correct response with collection data URI etc.
